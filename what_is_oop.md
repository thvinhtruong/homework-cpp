# What exactly is OOP? 
	Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming model in which everything is based on classes and objects. 
	A class is a blueprint used to construct objects. 
	Objects may have states and methods: 
	States are an object's properties. —-Methods are functions that can be used to communicate with an object's states. 
# OOP Advantages: 
	OOP represents complex things as reproducible, basic strings.
	Reusable, OOP objects can be used across programs —Allows for class-specific actions through polymorphism —Easier to debug, classes often contain all relevant information 
	Safe, encapsulates information to protect it. 

# Structure OOP programs as follows: 
	Create a parent class 
	Create a child class 
	Add special states and behaviors 
	Create artifacts from a child class

# OOP building blocks: 
	Classes: are basically user-defined data types in which we can create a template for attribute and method structure. 
	
	Objects: are instances created with unique data 
	
	Attributes: are the information that is stored, specified in the class template, when objects are instaniated individual objects contain data stored in the Attributes field.

	Methods are used to describe activities, perform actions, return information about an entity, or update the data of an object. In the class definition, define.
